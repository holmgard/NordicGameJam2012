>> Zone Conversion Utility <<

If you participated in the previous SFS2X beta versions you might want to migrate your previous zone definition files to the new release.

We provide a small python utlity called ZoneConverter to convert your files from SFS2X B10 or B14.

HowTo:
	- copy your previous files in this folder
	- run the python utility from command line (no arguments)
	- the utility will process all zone.xml files and create a zone.xml.new file for each entry
	
Now you can rename the new files with .zone.xml extension and copy them in the zone/ folder for testing.
If you have any problem you can contact us via email (see our website, www.smartfoxserver.com)
